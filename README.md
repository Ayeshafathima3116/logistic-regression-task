Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

📌 Objective:
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

 📁 Dataset:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from sklearn)

 🔧 Steps Performed:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training with Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC)

📈 Tools Used:
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

✅ Results:
Achieved high accuracy and ROC-AUC score with logistic regression.
